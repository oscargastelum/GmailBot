# GmailBot

GmailBot is a program that aims to receive, read, and reply to emails. It can be configured to run specific events based on email information that act as trigger events. The program actively listens for changes in the configured Gmail accounts' inbox and uses push notification features from the Gmail API to receive real-time updates as changes occur. The program then extracts the received email and displays it. Additionally, GmailBot can be configured to take action based on keywords from the email's sender, subject, or message. For example, if an email is from a specific sender, it can perform a specific action or if a keyword is found in the message, it can extract values and insert them into a database. Its applications are endless and ultimately depend on the developer's imagination.
