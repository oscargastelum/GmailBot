# GmailBot

#  Program description/ purpose : GmailBot aims to receive, read and also
# reply to emails. Can be configured to run specific events based on email 
# information that act as trigger events. GmailBot actively listens for 
# changes in the configured gmail accounts inbox. Every time a change
# occurs, GmailBot gets a callback. Using the push notification features
# from the GmailApi we get real time updates as changes occur. We then 
# extract the email received and display it. 
# GmailBot can be configured to act based on keywords from the emails 
# sender, subject or message. For example, if x sender, do y action... 
# if x keyword(s) in the message, extract values and insert them in a 
# database. If message subject "SPAM" and from x user, use the list of 
# emails from the emails from the emails message and spam all of them with 
# something. It's applications are endless and ultimately depend on the 
# developers imagination.
